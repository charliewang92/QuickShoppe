# QuickShoppe
 ## This app is designed to support in-store shoppers with in-store navigation, product checkout, and shopping list creation. 
 ## The instore navigation requires store-propriatry API
 ## The product checkout requires a scanner to be installed within the app to use the phone's camera
 ## The shopping list creation requires a ML classifer to classify the list of shopping items. 
 ## Still need more research on how the shopping list reconmmendation should be created
